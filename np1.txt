In the stillness of the night,
I hear the whispers of the stars,
A symphony of twinkling light,
As they twirl and dance afar.

The moon hangs high up in the sky,
A beacon of hope for all,
Its gentle glow a lullaby,
That answers to every call.

The world is silent, dark and deep,
A canvas for dreams to grow,
And in this peaceful, tranquil sleep,
My soul begins to flow
