In the stinight,
A symphony of twinkling light,
As they twirl and dance afar.

The m hangs high up in the sky,
A beacon of hope for all,
Its gentle glow a laby,
That answers to every call.

The world is silent, dark and deep,
A canvas for dreams to grow,
And inhis peaceful, tranquil sleep,
My soul begins to flow
